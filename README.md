## General Information
**Boom Bikes**: A US based bike sharing company has a large fleet of bikes. They have a large number of stations where they have a large number of bikes. Due to recent pandemic, Boom Bikes has lost his business and is looking for a way to overcome the loss, once the pandemic ends.

The company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands
## Goal:
* Develop a machine learning model which can describe the features which are important in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
* The model will then be used by marketing team of Boom Bikes to understand the demand for shared bikes.

## Conclusions
1. As we can see see there is a negative linear relation between spring season and bike count, meaning the marketing team has to expand there business during spring season
2. If windspeed is high it is risky for people to go out and rent out a bike and hence the bike count is low.
3. Marketing team should concentrate in the month of July, as the number of users in July are low
4. During rainy season, people prefer cabs over bikes, probably marketing team should focus on providing a gadget which could preotect people during rainy season
5. During holiday people prefer to stay at home, so the bike count is low, however if Boom bikes campaigns that some amount during holdays whould be donated to charities, then users will come forward and use Boom Bikes during holidays too.
